Focus on:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Bug risks
3. Performance issues
4. Best practice violations

For each issue found, provide:
- Severity: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Description of the issue
- Suggested fix

If the code looks good, say so.

IMPORTANT: At the very end of your review, add a severity summary line in exactly this format:
SEVERITY_SUMMARY: <level>
Where <level> is one of: CRITICAL, WARNING, GOOD

Use CRITICAL if any HIGH severity issues exist.
Use WARNING if only MEDIUM or LOW severity issues exist.
Use GOOD if no issues found.

Code diff to review:

{diff_text}


Provide your review in a clear, structured format, ending with the SEVERITY_SUMMARY line."""
